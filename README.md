## 1. Installation :

Since this is a front-end project based on HTML5, CSS and Vanilla javaScript no installation is required, you'll just have to clone it to your local repository and open the **index.html** file in your browser.

You can choose to use either the english version by openning the **index.html** file present in the en/ directory or the french version by opening the **index-fr.html** file present in the fr/ directory.

## 2. Usage :

Unlike the real game where two players oppose each other, here the player opposes the computer for a 5 round play.

At the end if the player gets a higher score than the computer he wins, otherwise if the score is lower then he loses.

Right after opening the **index.html** file, the player is on the main game page where he can find 2 groupes of buttons (May change on mobile!) :

- Buttons on the left-side of the interface :
  - The **?** button lets the player show the help box that explains the game rules and how to paly it.
  - The **Translation** button redirects the player to the other laguage page of the game (en -> fr) OR (fr -> en).
- Buttons in the center of the interface :
  These are the play buttons, during the game the player will choose each time one option by clicking on the according button. The game starts automatically when the player makes his first choice.

When the game starts and each time the palyer makes a choice, a box appears in the middle of the interface.
This box shows the game's info :

- The round that is played.
- The player's and computer's choice for the current round.
- The total score of the palyer and the computer.

At the end of the 5 round-play, the result is shown and a _Play again_ button appears on the bottom left side of the interface allowing the player to redo the game.
